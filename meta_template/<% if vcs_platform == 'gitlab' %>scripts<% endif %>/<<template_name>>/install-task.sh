# it against task.asc, the repo's signing key committed next to this script,

# this repo, not that it's the same build as when TASK_VERSION was pinned:
# Task publishes with GoReleaser's republish option, which replaces a package
# of the same version.

# Cloudsmith's setup.deb.sh and taskfile.dev/install.sh are avoided as they're
# scripts fetched and run at job time.

# TASK_VERSION is set in the CI file, where Renovate keeps it up to date.
