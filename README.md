A [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) meta-template — a template that scaffolds new Copier templates with modern Python project tooling preconfigured.

## Features

- **Best Practices:** template in subdirectory, [multiple (composable) template compatibility](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring/#applying-multiple-templates-to-the-same-subproject)
- **Test harness included** pytest setup with examples and helpers, ready to test your template, and it's usage
- **Modern Batteries included** uv, [semantic release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/), Renovate, and [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/) automation all preconfigured
- **CI/CD out of the box** Supports GitLab CI or GitHub Actions, with matrix testing across Python versions
- **Optional Copier extensions**
    - [Pydantic validation](https://pypi.org/project/copier-pydantic/) for answers
    - [local Jinja extensions](https://pypi.org/project/copier-template-extensions/)

## Install Copier

```bash
uv tool install copier
# or
pipx install copier
# or
brew install copier
```

## Usage

### Create a new project

```bash
# SSH
copier copy git@github.com:cbrown1234/copier-template-copier-template.git /path/to/new-template
# HTTPS
copier copy https://github.com/cbrown1234/copier-template-copier-template.git /path/to/new-template
```

For non-interactive usage (scripts, CI, AI agents), see `copier copy --help` for the `--defaults` and `--data` flags.

### Update an existing project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
copier update --answers-file .copier-answers.copier-template.yml
```

For non-interactive updates, use `--skip-answered` to reuse all existing answers without prompting.

## Development

Prerequisites: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [Task](https://taskfile.dev/).

Run `task --list` to see available commands. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development guide.

### Self-hosted

This repo uses itself. See `.copier-answers.copier-template.yml` for the answers used.

### Pre-commit composition

This template does not generate a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Pre-commit configuration is expected to be handled by a separate template that composes with this one.

## Beta features

Beta features are hidden: Copier doesn't ask about them, and uses the default unless you pass another value. Passing one records the answer, so `copier update` keeps it. Projects that keep the default are asked as normal once a feature graduates.

| Flag | Default | Other values | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `include_actions_lockfile` | `false` | `true` | GitHub only. Verify the [GitHub Actions workflow lockfile](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/workflow-dependency-lockfiles) in CI, and configure Renovate to keep it up to date |
| `gitlab_non_root_tests` | `false` | `true` | GitLab only. Run the generated CI tests as a non-root user, so permission issues (e.g. root-owned files from docker bind mounts) show up in CI as they would locally |
| `gitlab_docker` | `true` | `false` | GitLab only. Leave Docker out of the generated CI tests job (no docker:dind service or Docker CLI). Use it when the template's tests don't use Docker, to speed up the job (no waiting for the service to start or installing the client), or when your runners can't run privileged containers |
| `gitlab_prebuilt_ci_image` | `false` | `true` | GitLab only, needs `gitlab_docker`. Run the generated CI tests in an image prebuilt with their tools and Python versions, rebuilt in the project's container registry whenever the CI file or install scripts change. The tests still run the install scripts, which skip what the image already has, so a stale image only costs time, except for anything you add to the Dockerfile yourself. Building needs the project's container registry and a runner that can run docker:dind. MRs from forks need the fork to have built `:latest`, or the parent project to run fork MR pipelines. Renovate keeps the base image's digest current. To pick up Debian's package updates between changes, add a pipeline schedule on the default branch, which rebuilds without the cache |
| `pre_commit_tool` | `prek` | `pre-commit` | Run the hooks with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) instead of [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) in the dev-setup and lint tasks and the CI tests job |

### Usage

Opt in when creating a project:

```bash
copier copy -d include_actions_lockfile=true <template-url> /path/to/new-template
```

Or add it to an existing project:

```bash
copier update -d include_actions_lockfile=true --answers-file .copier-answers.copier-template.yml
```

Pass `-d <flag>=<value>` for each flag you want to change, with one of its other values. To go back, run `copier update` with `-d <flag>=<default>`.
